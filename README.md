# python-terminal-based-games

Terminal based games in Python.

I coded that while I was learning Python a few years ago.

Unfortunatly, everything is in **French**. I was not thinking of putting it online when I wrote it. But **the rules don't change**, so you can still give it a chance.

**Enjoy !**

# Features

- Le Pendu (Hangman)
- Morpion (Tic-tac-toe)
- Puissance 4 (Connect Four)
- Plus ou Moins ("Higher or Lower")
- Mastermind
- Sudoku
- Bataille Navale (Battle Ship)

The *two last ones* might be my best ones.

I also wrote a simple **AI** for the **Battle Ship**.

# Documentation

Sorry, it was one of my first codes. I did not comment it or anything.

But I am still available if there are any questions.
